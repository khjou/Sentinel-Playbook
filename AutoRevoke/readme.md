$MI = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId $MIGuid

$GraphAppId = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
$PermissionName = "User.ReadWrite.All" 

$GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"
$AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $PermissionName -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"}
New-AzureAdServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $MI.ObjectId -PrincipalId $MI.ObjectId `
-ResourceId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId -Id $AppRole.Id
